<title>Taxonomy - Galápagos tortoise</title>

<body>
<h2>Early classification</h2>
<p>The Galápagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, around 1570. The islands were named "Insulae de los Galopegos" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.</p>

<p>Initially, the giant tortoises of the Indian Ocean and those from the Galápagos were considered to be the same species. Naturalists thought that sailors had transported the tortoises there.[27] In 1676, the pre-Linnaean authority Claude Perrault referred to both species as Tortue des Indes.[28] In 1783, Johann Gottlob Schneider classified all giant tortoises as Testudo indica ("Indian tortoise").[29] In 1812, August Friedrich Schweigger named them Testudo gigantea ("gigantic tortoise").[30] In 1834, André Marie Constant Duméril and Gabriel Bibron classified the Galápagos tortoises as a separate species, which they named Testudo nigrita ("black tortoise").</p>

<h2>Recognition of subpopulations</h2>
<p>The first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by Albert Günther of the British Museum, in 1875. Günther identified at least five distinct populations from the Galápagos, and three from the Indian Ocean islands. He expanded the list in 1877 to six from the Galápagos, four from the Seychelles, and four from the Mascarenes. Günther hypothesized that all the giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken land bridges. This hypothesis was later disproven by the understanding that the Galápagos, Seychelles, and Mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked to a continent by land bridges. Galápagos tortoises are now thought to have descended from a South American ancestor, while the Indian Ocean tortoises derived from ancestral populations on Madagascar.</p>

<p>At the end of the 19th century, Georg Baur and Walter Rothschild recognised five more populations of Galápagos tortoise. In 1905-06, an expedition by the California Academy of Sciences, with Joseph R. Slevin in charge of reptiles, collected specimens which were studied by Academy herpetologist John Van Denburgh. He identified four additional populations,[6] and proposed the existence of 15 species.[35] Van Denburgh's list still guides the taxonomy of the Galápagos tortoise, though now 10 populations are thought to have existed.</p>

<h2> Current species and genus names</h2>
<p>The current specific designation of nigra ("black" – Quoy & Gaimard, 1824b[3]) was resurrected in 1984[36] after it was discovered to be the senior synonym (an older taxonomic synonym taking historical precedence) for the then commonly used species name of elephantopus ("elephant-footed" – Harlan, 1827[12]). Quoy and Gaimard's Latin description explains the use of nigra: "Testudo toto corpore nigro" means "tortoise with completely black body". Quoy and Gairmard described nigra from a living specimen, but no evidence indicates they knew of its accurate provenance within the Galápagos – the locality was in fact given as California. Garman proposed the linking of nigra with the extinct Floreana species.[7] Later, Pritchard deemed it convenient to accept this designation, despite its tenuousness, for minimal disruption to the already confused nomenclature of the species. The even more senior species synonym of californiana ("californian" – Quoy & Gaimard, 1824a[11]) is considered a nomen oblitum ("forgotten name").</p>

<p>Previously, the Galápagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus Geochelone, known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus Chelonoidis was elevated to generic status based on phylogenetic evidence which grouped the South American members of Geochelone into an independent clade (branch of the tree of life).[38] This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.</p>

<h2>Species</h2>

<p>Within the archipelago, up to 15 species of Galápagos tortoises have been identified, although only 11 survive to this day. Six are found on separate islands; five of them on the volcanoes of Isabela Island. Several of the surviving species are seriously endangered.[32] One of the species, C. abingdonii from Pinta Island, is considered extinct. The last known specimen, named Lonesome George, died in captivity on 24 June 2012; George had been mated with female tortoises of several other species, but none of the eggs from these pairings hatched. The species inhabiting Floreana Island (G. elaphantopus)[41] is thought to have been hunted to extinction by 1850,[42][43] only 15 years after Charles Darwin's landmark visit of 1835, when he saw shells, but no live tortoises there.[44] The existence of the C. phantastica species of Fernandina Island is disputed, as it was described from a single specimen that may have been an artificial introduction to the island.[45][46][47] However, recent DNA testing shows that an intermixed, non-native population currently existing on the island of Isabela is of genetic resemblance to the species native to Floreana, suggesting that G. elephantopus has not gone entirely extinct.</p>

<p>Prior to widespread knowledge of the differences between the populations (sometimes called races) from different islands and volcanoes, captive collections in zoos were indiscriminately mixed. Fertile offspring resulted from pairings of animals from different races. However, captive crosses between tortoises from different races have lower fertility and higher mortality than those between tortoises of the same race,[48][49] and captives in mixed herds normally direct courtship only toward members of the same race.</p>

<p>The valid scientific names of each of the individual populations are not universally accepted,[10][46][50][51] and some researchers consider each species to be subspecies.[52][53] The taxonomic status of the various races is not fully resolved.</p>
